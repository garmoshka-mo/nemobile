            <h3>1. Your Acceptance</h3>
            <br>                This is an agreement between dub.ink Inc., a California corporation (“dub.ink"), the owner and operator of www.dubink.herokuapp.com (the “dub.ink Site”), the dub.ink software, including dub.ink Messenger (collectively, including all content provided by dub.ink through dub.ink Messenger and the dub.ink Site, the "dub.ink Service", or the "Service"), and you (“you” or “You”), a user of the Service. BY USING THE SERVICE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, AND dub.ink'S PRIVACY POLICY, WHICH CAN BE FOUND AT http://dub.ink/, AND WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. If you choose to not agree with any of these terms, you may not use the Service.
            <br>    
            <br>                <h2>2. dub.ink Service</h2>
            <br>                These Terms of Service apply to all users of the dub.ink Service. Information provided by our users through the dub.ink Service may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by dub.ink. dub.ink has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites. In addition, dub.ink will not and cannot censor or edit the content of any third-party site. By using the Service, you expressly acknowledge and agree that dub.ink shall not be responsible for any damages, claims or other liability arising from or related to your use of any third-party website.
            <br>    
            <br>                <h2>3. dub.ink Access</h2>
            <br>                A. Subject to your compliance with these Terms of Service, dub.ink hereby grants you permission to use the Service, provided that: (i) your use of the Service as permitted is solely for your personal use, and you are not permitted to resell or charge others for use of or access to the Service, or in any other manner inconsistent with these Terms of Service; (ii) you will not duplicate, transfer, give access to, copy or distribute any part of the Service in any medium without dub.ink's prior written authorization; (iii) you will not attempt to reverse engineer, alter or modify any part of the Service; and (iv) you will otherwise comply with the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
            <br>    
            <br>                B. In order to access and use the features of the Service, you acknowledge and agree that you will have to provide dub.ink with your mobile phone number. You expressly acknowledge and agree that in order to provide the Service, dub.ink may periodically access your contact list and/or address book on your mobile device to find and keep track of mobile phone numbers of other users of the Service. When providing your mobile phone number, you must provide accurate and complete information. You hereby give your express consent to dub.ink to access your contact list and/or address book for mobile phone numbers in order to provide and use the Service. We do not collect names, addresses or email addresses, just mobile phone numbers. You are solely responsible for the status messages that you submit and that are displayed for your mobile phone number on the dub.ink Service. You must notify dub.ink immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your mobile phone. Although dub.ink will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable for the losses of dub.ink or others due to such unauthorized use.
            <br>    
            <br>                C. You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," "offline readers," etc. or "load testers" such as wget, apache bench, mswebstress, httpload, blitz, Xcode Automator, Android Monkey, etc., that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the dub.ink servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a dub.ink application, and you are forbidden from ripping the content unless specifically allowed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, dub.ink grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the website for the sole purpose of creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials. dub.ink reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases. While we don't disallow the use of sniffers such as Ethereal, tcpdump or HTTPWatch in general, we do disallow any efforts to reverse-engineer our system, our protocols, or explore outside the boundaries of the normal requests made by dub.ink clients. We have to disallow using request modification tools such as fiddler or whisker, or the like or any other such tools activities that are meant to explore or harm, penetrate or test the site. You must secure our permission before you measure, test, health check or otherwise monitor any network equipment, servers or assets hosted on our domain. You agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable information, including phone number, from the Service, nor to use the communication systems provided by the Service for any commercial solicitation or spam purposes. You agree not to spam, or solicit for commercial purposes, any users of the Service.
            <br>    
            <br>                <h2>4. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
            <br>                The design of the dub.ink Service along with dub.ink created text, scripts, graphics, interactive features and the like, except Status Submissions (as defined below), and the trademarks, service marks and logos contained therein ("Marks"), are owned by or licensed to dub.ink, subject to copyright and other intellectual property rights under United States and foreign laws and international conventions. The Service is provided to you AS IS for your information and personal use only. dub.ink reserves all rights not expressly granted in and to the Service. You agree to not engage in the use, copying, or distribution of any of the Service other than expressly permitted herein, including any use, copying, or distribution of Status Submissions of third parties obtained through the Service for any commercial purposes.
            <br>    
            <br>                <h2>5. User Status Submissions</h2>
            <br>                A. The dub.ink Service allows dub.ink users to submit status text, profile photos and other communications submitted by you, as well as the automatic submission of your “last seen” status (collectively, the "Status Submissions"). These Status Submissions may be hosted, shared, and/or published as part of the dub.ink Service, and may be visible to other users of the Service who have your mobile phone number in their mobile phone and which you have not expressly blocked. For clarity, direct messages, location data and photos or files that you send directly to other dub.ink users will only be viewable by those dub.ink user(s) or group(s) you directly send such information; but Status Submissions may be globally viewed by dub.ink users that have your mobile phone number on their smartphone, unless the user is blocked by you. Currently, we have no method of providing different levels of visibility of your Status Submissions among users that have your mobile phone number – you acknowledge and agree that any Status Submissions may be globally viewed by users that have your mobile phone number, so don’t submit or post status messages or profile photos that you don’t want to be seen globally. A good rule of thumb is if you don’t want the whole world to know something or see something, don’t submit it as a Status Submission to the Service. The submission of your 'last seen' status is done on an automatic basis. As clarified in the following section, you retain your ownership rights in your Status Submissions. You understand that whether or not such Status Submissions are published, dub.ink does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any submissions.
            <br>    
            <br>                B. You shall be solely responsible for your own Status Submissions and the consequences of posting or publishing them. Because dub.ink is only acting as a repository of data, user submitted statuses do not necessarily represent the views or opinions of dub.ink, and dub.ink makes no guarantees as to the validity, accuracy or legal status of any status. In connection with Status Submissions, you affirm, represent, and/or warrant that: (i) you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to use and authorize dub.ink to use all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights in and to any and all Status Submissions to enable inclusion and use of the Status Submissions in the manner contemplated by the Service and these Terms of Service; and (ii) you have the written consent, release, and/or permission of each and every identifiable individual person in the Status Submission to use the name or likeness of each and every such identifiable individual person to enable inclusion and use of the Status Submissions in the manner contemplated by the Service and these Terms of Service. To be clear: you retain all of your ownership rights in your Status Submissions, but you have to have the rights in the first place. However, by submitting the Status Submissions to dub.ink, you hereby grant dub.ink a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicenseable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the Status Submissions in connection with the dub.ink Service and dub.ink's (and its successor's) business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the dub.ink Service (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. You also hereby grant each subscriber to your status on the dub.ink Service a non-exclusive license to access your Status Submissions through the Service. The foregoing license granted by you terminates once you remove or delete a Status Submission from the dub.ink Service.
            <br>    
            <br>                C. In connection with Status Submissions, you further agree that you will not: (i) submit material that is copyrighted, protected by trade secret or otherwise subject to third party proprietary rights, including privacy and publicity rights, unless you are the owner of such rights or have permission from their rightful owner to post the material and to grant dub.ink all of the license rights granted herein; (ii) publish falsehoods or misrepresentations that could damage dub.ink or any third party; (iii) submit material that is unlawful, obscene, defamatory, libelous, threatening, harassing, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive, or encourages conduct that would be considered a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, violate any law, or is otherwise inappropriate; (iv) post advertisements or solicitations of business; (v) impersonate another person; (vi) send or store material containing software viruses, worms, Trojan horses or other harmful computer code, files, scripts, agents or programs; (vii) interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Service or the data contained therein; or (viii) attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service or its related systems or networks.
            <br>    
            <br>                D. Adult content must be identified as such. dub.ink does not endorse any Status Submission or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and dub.ink expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with Status Submissions. dub.ink does not permit copyright infringing activities and infringement of intellectual property rights via its Service, and dub.ink will remove all content and Status Submissions if properly notified that such content or Status Submission infringes on another's intellectual property rights. To file a copyright infringement notification, please send a written communication that includes substantially the following (see Section 512(c)(3) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act): (i) A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (ii) Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works; (iii) Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material, including the mobile phone number of the dub.ink user allegedly infringing the copyrighted work; (iv) Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted; (v) A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (vi) A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. Such takedown notices may be emailed to support at dubink.herokuapp.com. dub.ink reserves the right to remove content and Status Submissions without prior notice. dub.ink may also terminate a user's access to the Service, if they are determined to be a repeat infringer, or for any or no reason, including being annoying. A repeat infringer is a User who has been notified of infringing activity more than once and/or has had a Status Submission removed from the Service more than twice. An annoying person is anyone who is (capriciously or not) determined to be annoying by authorized dub.ink employees, agents, subagents, superagents or superheros. dub.ink also reserves the right to decide whether content or a Status Submission is appropriate and complies with these Terms of Service for violations other than copyright infringement and violations of intellectual property law, such as, but not limited to excessive length or limited interest. dub.ink may remove such Status Submissions and/or terminate a User's access for uploading such material in violation of these Terms of Service at any time, without prior notice and at its sole discretion.
            <br>    
            <br>                E. You understand that when using the dub.ink Service you will be exposed to Status Submissions from a variety of sources, and that dub.ink is not responsible for the accuracy, usefulness, safety, or intellectual property rights of or relating to such Status Submissions, and that such Status Submissions are not the responsibility of dub.ink. You further understand and acknowledge that you may be exposed to Status Submissions that are inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable, and you agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against dub.ink with respect thereto, and agree to indemnify and hold dub.ink, its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, and/or licensors, harmless to the fullest extent allowed by law regarding all matters related to your use of the dub.ink Service.
            <br>    
            <br>                F. dub.ink permits you to link to materials on the Service for personal purposes only. dub.ink reserves the right to discontinue any aspect of the dub.ink Service at any time.
            <br>    
            <br>                <h2>6. Warranty Disclaimer</h2>
            <br>                YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE dub.ink SERVICE SHALL BE AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, dub.ink, ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE AND YOUR USE THEREOF. dub.ink MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THIS SERVICE'S CONTENT AND ASSUMES NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY (I) ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR INACCURACIES OF CONTENT, (II) PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE, OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER, RESULTING FROM YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF OUR SERVICE, (III) ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF OUR SERVERS AND/OR ANY AND ALL PERSONAL INFORMATION AND/OR FINANCIAL INFORMATION STORED THEREIN, (IV) ANY INTERRUPTION OR CESSATION OF TRANSMISSION TO OR FROM OUR SERVICE, (IV) ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES, OR THE LIKE WHICH MAY BE TRANSMITTED TO OR THROUGH OUR SERVICE THROUGH THE ACTIONS OF ANY THIRD PARTY, AND/OR (V) ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONSIN ANY CONTENT OR FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF ANY CONTENT POSTED, EMAILED, TRANSMITTED, OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE VIA THE dub.ink SERVICE. dub.ink DOES NOT WARRANT, ENDORSE, GUARANTEE, OR ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE ADVERTISED OR OFFERED BY A THIRD PARTY THROUGH THE dub.ink SERVICE OR ANY HYPERLINKED WEBSITE OR FEATURED IN ANY USER STATUS SUBMISSION OR OTHER ADVERTISING, AND dub.ink WILL NOT BE A PARTY TO OR IN ANY WAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING ANY TRANSACTION BETWEEN YOU AND THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. AS WITH THE PURCHASE OF A PRODUCT OR SERVICE THROUGH ANY MEDIUM OR IN ANY ENVIRONMENT, YOU SHOULD USE YOUR BEST JUDGMENT AND EXERCISE CAUTION WHERE APPROPRIATE. AND AGAIN, USE THIS JUST FOR FUN.
            <br>    
            <br>                <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <br>                IN NO EVENT SHALL dub.ink, ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, OR AGENTS, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM ANY (I) ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR INACCURACIES OF CONTENT, (II) PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE, OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER, RESULTING FROM YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF OUR SERVICE, (III) ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF OUR SECURE SERVERS AND/OR ANY AND ALL PERSONAL INFORMATION AND/OR FINANCIAL INFORMATION STORED THEREIN, (IV) ANY INTERRUPTION OR CESSATION OF TRANSMISSION TO OR FROM OUR SERVERS, (IV) ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES, OR THE LIKE, WHICH MAY BE TRANSMITTED TO OR THROUGH OUR SERVICE BY ANY THIRD PARTY, (V) ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN ANY CONTENT OR FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND INCURRED AS A RESULT OF YOUR USE OF ANY CONTENT POSTED, EMAILED, TRANSMITTED, OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE VIA THE dub.ink CLIENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE COMPANY IS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND/OR (VI) THE DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION PURSUANT TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE OR PRIVACY POLICY. THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW IN THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION.
            <br>    
            <br>                YOU SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT dub.ink SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR USER SUBMISSIONS OR THE DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE, OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY AND THAT THE RISK OF HARM OR DAMAGE FROM THE FOREGOING RESTS ENTIRELY WITH YOU.
            <br>    
            <br>                The Service is controlled and offered by dub.ink from its facilities in the United States of America. dub.ink makes no representations that the dub.ink Service is appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the dub.ink Service from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are responsible for compliance with local law.
            <br>    
            <br>                <h2>8. Indemnity</h2>
            <br>                You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless dub.ink, its parent corporation, officers, directors, employees and agents, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees) arising from: (i) your use of and access to the dub.ink Service; (ii) your violation of any term of these Terms of Service; (iii) your violation of any third party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or privacy right; or (iv) any claim that one of your Status Submissions caused damage to a third party.

            <br>    
            <br>                <h2>9. Ability to Accept Terms of Service</h2>
            <br>                You affirm that you are either more than 16 years of age, or an emancipated minor, or possess legal parental or guardian consent, and are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and warranties set forth in these Terms of Service, and to abide by and comply with these Terms of Service. In any case, you affirm that you are at least 16 years old as the dub.ink Service is not intended for children under 16. If you are under 16 years of age, you are not permitted to use the dub.ink Service. You further represent and warrant that you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a” terrorist-supporting” country, and that you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties. 
            <br>    
            <br>                <h2>10. Assignment</h2>
            <br>                These Terms of Service, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by dub.ink without restriction.
            <br>    
            <br>                <h2>11. General</h2>
            <br>                You agree that: (i) the dub.ink Service shall be deemed solely based in California; (ii) the dub.ink Service shall be deemed a passive server that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over dub.ink, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California; and (iii) that you agree to subject to the jurisdiction of California in the event of any legal dispute. These Terms of Service shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. Any claim or dispute between you and dub.ink that arises in whole or in part from the dub.ink Service shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Santa Clara County, California. These Terms of Service, together with the Privacy Policy at http://dub.ink/ and any other legal notices published by dub.ink, including, but not limited to an end user license agreement, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and dub.ink concerning the dub.ink Service. If any provision of these Terms of Service is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Service, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of this these Terms of Service shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and dub.ink's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. dub.ink reserves the right to amend or modify these Terms of Service at any time, and it is your responsibility to review these Terms of Service for any changes. If you do not agree to the revised Terms, your only recourse is to discontinue the use of the dub.ink Service. Your continued use of the dub.ink Service following any amendment of these Terms of Service will signify your assent to and acceptance of its revised terms. YOU AND dub.ink AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE dub.ink SERVICE MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.

            <br>                dub.ink does not collect names, emails, addresses or other contact information from its users’ mobile address book or contact lists other than mobile phone numbers—the dub.ink mobile application will associate whatever name the dub.ink user has assigned to the mobile telephone number in his/her mobile address book or contact list — and this occurs dynamically on the mobile device itself and not on dub.ink’s servers and is not transmitted to dub.ink. This means that if you have your friend’s mobile phone number associated with the name “Shakespeare” in your mobile address book, that’s the name that will appear for that mobile phone number in your dub.ink contact list. We do not collect location data, but users may voluntarily share their location with other users via the dub.ink Service.
            <br>    
            <br>                The contents of messages that have been delivered by the dub.ink Service are not copied, kept or archived by dub.ink in the normal course of business. The dub.ink Service is meant to be a SMS replacement, using data service through a user’s phone (either via cell network or wifi). Users type their messages, which are sent via data service to our servers, and routed to the intended recipient (who must also be a dub.ink user), if that recipient is online. If the recipient is not online, the undelivered message is held in dub.ink’s server until it can be delivered. If the message is undelivered for thirty (30) days, the undelivered message is deleted from our servers. Once a message has been delivered, it no longer resides on our servers. The contents of any delivered messages are not kept or retained by dub.ink — the only records of the content of any delivered messages reside directly on the sender’s and recipient’s mobile devices (and which may be deleted at the user’s option). Notwithstanding the above, dub.ink may retain date and time stamp information associated with successfully delivered messages and the mobile phone numbers involved in the messages, as well as any other information which dub.ink is legally compelled to collect. Files that are sent through the dub.ink Service will reside on our servers after delivery for a short period of time, but are deleted and stripped of any identifiable information within a short period of time in accordance with our general retention policies.

            <br>                The Way dub.ink Uses Information
            <br>                If you submit Personally Identifiable Information to us through the dub.ink Site, or dub.ink Service, then we use your personal information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the dub.ink Site and dub.ink Service. In particular, your mobile phone number is essential to your use of the dub.ink Service and will be retained. Any billing information that may be collected from you will be deleted thirty (30) days after the termination of your account with dub.ink. Any Personally Identifiable Information or status content that you voluntarily disclose on the dub.ink Service becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by other users of the dub.ink Service (unless such user is blocked by you). Your name (as it is saved in other user's mobile phone address book or contact list) may be displayed to other users when you update your status messages through the dub.ink Service and other users may contact you through the dub.ink Service. We do not use your mobile phone number or other Personally Identifiable Information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your mobile phone number (or email address, if provided) without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major dub.ink Site or dub.ink Service changes or for customer service purposes). We may use both your Personally Identifiable Information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous user usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the dub.ink Site and dub.ink Service and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing user preferences and trends. Hopefully we improve the dub.ink Site and Service and don't make it suck worse. We may use cookies and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you use the dub.ink Service or dub.ink Site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor individual and aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (d) track your entries, submissions, views and such.

            <br>                When dub.ink Discloses Information
            <br>                Other users of the dub.ink Service may see your Status Submissions in a way that is consistent with the use of the dub.ink Service. For example, a status of "Can't talk, please SMS instead" set by phone number +1 (408) 555-1212 will be available to every user of the dub.ink Service who has that mobile phone number in their mobile phone’s address book or contact list. In other words: If another user has your mobile phone number stored in their mobile phone address book or contact list, they will be able see your status information unless you have chosen to block such user. “Last Seen” information is available and displayed to each user who has your mobile phone number in their mobile phone address book or contact book (and which you have not blocked), and reflects the last approximate time the dub.ink mobile application has been used or brought to the foreground on your mobile phone. “Last Seen” information is reported to dub.ink when a user brings the mobile application to the foreground.
            <br>    
            <br>                We do not sell or share your Personally Identifiable Information (such as mobile phone number) with other third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with third party service providers to the extent that it is reasonably necessary to perform, improve or maintain the dub.ink Service. We may share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, asset views, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the dub.ink Site. We may collect and release Personally Identifiable Information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law), international law or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant or equivalent, or where in our reasonable belief, an individual’s physical safety may be at risk or threatened. dub.ink also reserves the right to disclose Personally Identifiable Information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that dub.ink believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Service, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of the dub.ink Site or our servers, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of dub.ink, our users or others.

            <br>                Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites
            <br>                We are not fans of advertising. dub.ink is currently ad-free and we hope to keep it that way forever. We have no intention to introduce advertisement into the product, but if we ever do, will update this section.

            <br>                dub.ink uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to dub.ink and you do so at your own risk. Using unsecured wifi or other unprotected networks to submit messages through the dub.ink Service is never recommended. Once we receive your transmission of information, dub.ink makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. If dub.ink learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. dub.ink may post a notice on the dub.ink Site or through the dub.ink Service if a security breach occurs.

            <br>                Our Commitment To Childrens' Privacy
            <br>                Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, dub.ink does not knowingly collect or maintain Personally Identifiable Information or non-personally-identifiable information on the dub.ink Site or dub.ink Service from persons under 16 years of age, and no part of the dub.ink Service is directed to or intended to be used by persons under 16. If you are under 16 years of age, then please do not use the dub.ink Service or access the dub.ink Site at any time or in any manner. If dub.ink learns that Personally Identifiable Information of persons under 16 years of age has been collected on the dub.ink Site or dub.ink Service, then dub.ink may deactivate the account and/or make the status submissions inaccessible. And always, think of the children!
